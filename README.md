# Object-Detection-and-Distance-Measurement-using-Mobile-Net-SSD
Using OpenCV 4.0.1, Python 3.8 and Tensorflow 2.3, object detection and distance measurement in real-time is obtained.
For distance measurement, Traingle Similarity algorithm is used. For more information visit this link :

and this repo : https://github.com/Subikshaa/Social-Distance-Detection-using-OpenCV/blob/master/social_distance_detection.py
Webcam is used to capture the video, detect the objects and measure the distance from webcam in real-time.
